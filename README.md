# Sales Performance Analysis with Pandas
This project is a mid-course hands-on exercise that showcases how to leverage Pandas for real-world data analysis. Using a retail dataset, I explored sales patterns to draw meaningful insights that could help guide business strategy.

## Project Objective
To explore, manipulate, and analyze structured sales data using Pandas with the aim of answering key business questions such as:

Which product categories generate the most revenue?

How do different genders and age groups contribute to sales?

What are the seasonal or monthly trends in purchasing behavior?

## What I Did
- Data Cleaning: Removed inconsistencies, handled missing values, and ensured the dataset was analysis-ready.
- Descriptive Analysis: Calculated total sales, average transaction values, and performed group-wise aggregations.
- Demographic Breakdown: Analyzed customer data based on gender and age groups.
- Date-Time Analysis: Parsed and extracted insights from date columns to evaluate monthly and yearly sales trends.
- Top Product Analysis: Identified best-selling departments, customer segments, and peak periods.

## Key Highlights
- Grouped and analyzed data by **GENDER**, **AGE_DESC**, and **DEPARTMENT**.

- Generated pivot tables to compare performance metrics across demographics.

- Used visual styling (e.g., _background gradients_) to highlight trends.

- Exported cleaned and aggregated data to Excel for easy reporting.

ðŸ› ## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel (for output reporting)

## Outcome
This project strengthened my skills in:
- Transforming raw data into business insights.
- Performing group-based aggregations and cross-tabulations.
- Generating visually intuitive outputs for stakeholders.
